# 🔄 Image-to-Image Translation using pix2pix (cGAN)

Implement an **image-to-image translation** model using a **Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)** architecture known as **pix2pix**. This project demonstrates how models can learn to map one type of image to another—such as converting sketches to photos, grayscale images to color, or day to night scenes.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Understand the architecture and working of conditional GANs.
- Train the pix2pix model on paired image datasets.
- Translate input images into realistic output images using learned mappings.
- Evaluate visual quality of generated images.
